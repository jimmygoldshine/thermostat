A Digital Thermostat
=================
* A page built using JQuery to emulate a digital thermometer to control your home's heating.

Set Up:

* Run ```$ open Thermostat.html``` from the terminal.

Usage:

* Use the up and down arrows to adjust the desired temperature.

* While "Power Saver Mode" is disabled, temperature can be set between 10 and 32 degrees.
* There is a "Reset" button to reset the thermostat temperature to 20 degrees.
* The thermostat utilizes the http://openweathermap.org/ API to pull in the temperature in any city the user wishes.
